Tryp.com is a Danish online travel agency (CVR No. 42533165), with office at Dronningens Tværgade 7, in Copenhagen. We hold an International Air Transport Association (IATA) Travel Industry Designator Service (TIDS) license, with the number 96109333 and as an online travel agency, we facilitate the booking of transportation services (including rail, buses, flights, and ferries), ancillary services, and accommodation. Our platform is free to use, and always will be. We receive commissions for the content we sell, but we will always prioritize giving you the best deals. Our users are our number one concern which is why we are committed to full transparency on prices and fees and providing you with top customer support, as we will be available for support at any point of your trip. We aim to be your own personal travel assistant.

We have all been there… dozens of tabs open, buying flights on ten different pages, and managing everything ourselves. The upselling in maze-like websites… And then you forget to check-in in that low-cost carrier in time, and suddenly the trip starts getting expensive. In 2019, during a pandemic, we got tired of these issues, formed a team of young engineering students and marketeers, and started working on Tryp.com. Since then, Tryp.com has been backed by the Danish Growth Fund and international investors with an advisory board of industry leaders. Tryp.com has been growing quickly, with millions of users from all over the world. Our commitment is to create the best adventures, from anywhere to anywhere.
